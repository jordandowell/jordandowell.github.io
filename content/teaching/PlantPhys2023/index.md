Covers core concepts in plant physiology, explicitly focusing on photosynthesis, respiration, water relations, mineral nutrition, growth and allocation, hormones, secondary metabolites, reproduction, and stress physiology. Students will develop an understanding of the integration of plant physiological traits and their role in plant-environment interactions, as well as gain skills in assessing key plant physiological traits through hands-on practice. The course format will consist of lectures and an accompanying laboratory section where students will conduct a semester-long research project to assess plant traits and responses to critical stimuli. Your active engagement in the research and/or creative scholarship process will be the core of your learning experience in this course. A significant portion of your Biol/Plhl 3060 grade will be derived from your active participation in the research process and the tangible course-related project(s) that comes out of this project.
