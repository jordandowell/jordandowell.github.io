Melanie is a PhD student in the Dowell Lab. Her research focuses on how host-pathogen interactions shape necrotrophic fungal resistance mechanisms and how plant specialized metabolites can be used for novel biocontrol strategies. 
She is also interested in the toxicology of plant-derived compounds and their effects on non-target organisms.
